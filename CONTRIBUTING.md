GeoMesa is an open source suite of tools that enables large-scale geospatial querying and analytics on distributed
computing systems. GeoMesa provides spatio-temporal indexing on top of the Accumulo, HBase and
Cassandra databases for massive storage of point, line, and polygon data. GeoMesa also provides near real time
stream processing of spatio-temporal data by layering spatial semantics on top of Apache Kafka. Through GeoServer,
GeoMesa facilitates integration with a wide range of existing mapping clients over standard OGC (Open Geospatial
Consortium) APIs and protocols such as WFS and WMS. GeoMesa supports Apache Spark for custom distributed
geospatial analytics.

In the following sections you can find some guidelines on how to contribute.
As PROJ is managed on GitHub most contributions require that you have a GitHub
account. Familiarity with [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and
the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is an advantage.

License and Copyright
---------------------

GeoMesa is provided under the Apache 2 license, and any contributions must maintain this. To ensure proper
licensing, source files must contain an appropriate license header. When a file is created or modified,
the contributor should also indicate their copyright in the header. If copyright is not desired, the contributor
may delegate the copyright to CCRi, as per the default header.

GeoMesa uses the [License Maven Plugin](https://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/) to help manage copyright
headers. This plugin runs as part of the default build, and will fail if any files do not contain a valid header.
To add a new copyright owner, a template file can be placed under `build/copyright/` and added to the
`<validHeaders>` block in the root pom.xml.

Generally speaking the key issues are that those providing code to be included in the repository
understand that the code will be released under the MIT/X license, and that the person providing
the code has the right to contribute the code. For the committer themselves understanding about
the license is hopefully clear. For other contributors, the committer should verify the understanding
unless the committer is very comfortable that the contributor understands the license (for
instance frequent contributors).
