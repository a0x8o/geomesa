.. _accumulo_install_source:

Building from Source
--------------------

GeoMesa Accumulo may also be built from source. For more information, refer to the instructions on
`GitHub <https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa#building-from-source>`__.
The remainder of the instructions in this chapter assume the use of the binary GeoMesa Accumulo
distribution. If you have built from source, the distribution is created in the ``target`` directory of
``geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-dist``.

.. _install_accumulo_runtime:

Installing the Accumulo Distributed Runtime Library
---------------------------------------------------

The ``geomesa-accumulo_$VERSION/dist/accumulo/`` directory contains the distributed
runtime JAR that contains server-side code for Accumulo that must be made
available on each of the Accumulo tablet servers in the cluster. This JAR
contains GeoMesa code and the Accumulo iterators required for querying GeoMesa data.

The version of the distributed runtime JAR must match the version of the GeoMesa
data store client JAR (usually installed in GeoServer; see below). If not,
queries might not work correctly or at all.

.. _install_accumulo_runtime_namespace:

Namespace Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    GeoMesa 4.0.x is not compatible with Accumulo namespace installs. Upgrade to GeoMesa 5.0.0 or later in order
    to use namespace installs.

GeoMesa leverages namespaces and classpath contexts to isolate the GeoMesa
classpath from the rest of Accumulo.

To install the distributed runtime JAR, first copy it into HDFS:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ hadoop fs -mkdir /accumulo/classpath/myNamespace
    $ hadoop fs -put \
      geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/dist/accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-distributed-runtime_${VERSION}.jar \
      /accumulo/classpath/myNamespace/

Then configure the namespace classpath through the Accumulo shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ accumulo shell -u root

Once in the shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    > createnamespace myNamespace
    > grant NameSpace.CREATE_TABLE -ns myNamespace -u myUser
    > config -s general.vfs.context.classpath.myNamespace=hdfs://NAME_NODE_FDQN:9000/accumulo/classpath/myNamespace/[^.].*.jar
    > config -ns myNamespace -s table.classpath.context=myNamespace

.. note::

    The path above is just an example; you can included nested folders with project
    names, version numbers, and other information in order to have different versions of GeoMesa on
    the same Accumulo instance. You should remove any GeoMesa JARs under
    ``$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext`` to prevent classpath conflicts.

.. note::

    When connecting to a data store using Accumulo namespaces, you must prefix
    the ``accumulo.catalog`` parameter with the namespace. For example, refer to the
    ``my_catalog`` table as ``myNamespace.my_catalog``.

.. _install_accumulo_runtime_manual:

System Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    This approach is not recommended, as the GeoMesa classes will be on the global
    Accumulo classpath, and may conflict with other custom JARs installed in Accumulo.

Alternatively, the GeoMesa runtime JAR can be copied into the ``$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/`` folder on
each tablet server.

.. note::

    In Accumulo versions prior to 2.1, the JAR should be copied into ``$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/ext/`` instead.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ for tserver in $(cat $ACCUMULO_HOME/conf/tservers); do \
        scp dist/accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-distributed-runtime_${VERSION}.jar \
        $tserver:$ACCUMULO_HOME/lib/; done

.. _setting_up_accumulo_commandline:

Setting up the Accumulo Command Line Tools
------------------------------------------

.. warning::

    To use the Accumulo data store with the command line tools, you need to install
    the distributed runtime first. See :ref:`install_accumulo_runtime`.

GeoMesa comes with a set of command line tools for managing Accumulo features located in
``geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/bin/`` of the binary distribution.

GeoMesa requires ``java`` to be available on the default path.

Configuring the Classpath
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoMesa needs Accumulo and Hadoop JARs on the classpath. These are not bundled by default, as they should match
the versions installed on the target system.

If the environment variables ``ACCUMULO_HOME`` and ``HADOOP_HOME`` are set, then GeoMesa will load the appropriate
JARs and configuration files from those locations and no further configuration is required. Otherwise, you will
be prompted to download the appropriate JARs the first time you invoke the tools. Environment variables can be
specified in ``conf/*-env.sh`` and dependency versions can be specified in ``conf/dependencies.sh``.

In order to run map/reduce jobs, the Hadoop ``*-site.xml`` configuration files from your Hadoop installation
must be on the classpath. If ``HADOOP_HOME`` is not set, then copy them into ``geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/conf``.

GeoMesa also provides the ability to add additional JARs to the classpath using the environmental variable
``$GEOMESA_EXTRA_CLASSPATHS``. GeoMesa will prepend the contents of this environmental variable  to the computed
classpath, giving it highest precedence in the classpath. Users can provide directories of jar files or individual
files using a colon (``:``) as a delimiter. These entries will also be added the the map-reduce libjars variable.

Due to licensing restrictions, dependencies for shape file support must be separately installed.
Do this with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/install-shapefile-support.sh

For logging, see :ref:`slf4j_configuration` for information about configuring the SLF4J implementation.

Use the ``geomesa-accumulo classpath`` command to print the final classpath that will be used when executing GeoMesa
commands.

Running Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test the command that invokes the GeoMesa Tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ geomesa-accumulo

The output should look like this::

    Usage: geomesa-accumulo [command] [command options]
      Commands:
      ...

For details on the available commands, see :ref:`accumulo_tools`.

.. _install_accumulo_geoserver:

Installing GeoMesa Accumulo in GeoServer
----------------------------------------

.. warning::

    See :ref:`geoserver_versions` to ensure that GeoServer is compatible with your GeoMesa version.

Installing GeoServer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in :ref:`geomesa_and_geoserver`, GeoMesa implements a `GeoTools`_-compatible data store. This makes
it possible to use GeoMesa Accumulo as a data store in `GeoServer`_. GeoServer's web site includes
`installation instructions for GeoServer`_.

.. _installation instructions for GeoServer: https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/index.html

After GeoServer is running, you may optionally install the WPS plugin. The GeoServer WPS Plugin must match the
version of your GeoServer instance. The GeoServer website includes instructions for downloading
and installing `the WPS plugin`_.

.. _the WPS plugin: https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wps/install.html

.. note::

    If using Tomcat as a web server, it will most likely be necessary to
    pass some custom options::

        export CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx8g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -Duser.timezone=UTC \
        -server -Djava.awt.headless=true"

    The value of ``-Xmx`` should be as large as your system will permit. Be sure to
    restart Tomcat for changes to take place.

Installing the GeoMesa Accumulo Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the GeoMesa data store, extract the contents of the
``geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin_${VERSION}-install.tar.gz`` file in ``geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/dist/gs-plugins/``
in the binary distribution or ``geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin/target/`` in the source
distribution into your GeoServer's ``lib`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-accumulo-gs-plugin_${VERSION}-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib

Next, install the JARs for Accumulo and Hadoop. By default, JARs will be downloaded from Maven central. You may
override this by setting the environment variable ``GEOMESA_MAVEN_URL``. If you do no have an internet connection
you can download the JARs manually.

Edit the file ``geomesa-accumulo_${VERSION}/conf/dependencies.sh`` to set the versions of Accumulo and Hadoop
to match the target environment, and then run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/install-dependencies.sh /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib

.. warning::

   Due to a classpath conflict with GeoServer, the version of Accumulo client JARs installed must be 1.9.2 or later.
   Note that newer Accumulo clients can talk to older Accumulo instances, so it is only necessary to upgrade the
   client JARs in GeoServer, but not the entire Accumulo cluster.

.. warning::

    GeoServer ships with an older version of commons-text, 1.4. The ``install-dependencies.sh`` script will
    remove it, but if you don't use the script you will need to delete it manually.

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

.. _install_geomesa_process:

Install GeoMesa Processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoMesa provides some WPS processes, such as ``geomesa:Density`` which is used to generate heat maps. In order
to use these processes, install the GeoServer WPS plugin as described in :ref:`geomesa_process`.

Upgrading
---------

To upgrade between minor releases of GeoMesa, the versions of all GeoMesa components
**must** match. This means that the version of the ``geomesa-distributed-runtime``
JAR installed on Accumulo tablet servers **must** match the version of the
``geomesa-plugin`` JARs installed in the ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory of GeoServer.

See :ref:`upgrade_guide` for more details on upgrading between versions.
