.. _fsds_install_source:

Building from Source
--------------------

GeoMesa FileSystem may also be built from source. For more information, refer to the instructions on
`GitHub <https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa#building-from-source>`__.
The remainder of the instructions in this chapter assume the use of the binary GeoMesa
distribution. If you have built from source, the distribution is created in the ``target`` directory of
``geomesa-fs/geomesa-fs-dist``.

.. _setting_up_fsds_commandline:

Setting up the FileSystem Command Line Tools
--------------------------------------------

The FileSystem command line tools require Hadoop to run. If ``HADOOP_HOME`` is defined, or ``hadoop`` is available
on the path, the tools will use the local Hadoop installation. Otherwise, when first run they will prompt to download
the necessary JARs. Environment variables can be specified in ``conf/*-env.sh`` and dependency versions can be
specified in ``conf/dependencies.sh``.

Note that you will need the proper Yarn/Hadoop environment configured if you would like to run a distributed ingest
job.

If you are using a service such as Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) or have a distribution of Apache Hadoop, Cloudera, or
Hortonworks installed you can likely run something like this to configure hadoop for the tools:

.. code-block:: bash

    # These will be specific to your Hadoop environment
    $ . /etc/hadoop/conf/hadoop-env.sh
    $ . /etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-env.sh
    $ export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf

After installing the tarball you should be able to run the ``geomesa-fs`` command like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GEOMESA_FS_HOME
    $ bin/geomesa-fs

The output should look like this::

    INFO  Usage: geomesa-fs [command] [command options]
      Commands:
        ...

.. _install_fsds_geoserver:

Installing GeoMesa FileSystem in GeoServer
------------------------------------------

.. warning::

    See :ref:`geoserver_versions` to ensure that GeoServer is compatible with your GeoMesa version.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To install the GeoMesa data store, extract the contents of the
``geomesa-fs-gs-plugin_${VERSION}-install.tar.gz`` file in ``geomesa-fs_${VERSION}/dist/gs-plugins/``
in the binary distribution or ``geomesa-fs/geomesa-fs-gs-plugin/target/`` in the source
distribution into your GeoServer's ``lib`` directory:

The FileSystem GeoServer plugin is bundled by default in the GeoMesa FS binary distribution. To install, extract
``$GEOMESA_FS_HOME/dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-fs-gs-plugin_${VERSION}-install.tar.gz`` into GeoServer's
``WEB-INF/lib`` directory. Note that this plugin contains a shaded JAR with Parquet 1.9.0
bundled. If you require a different version, modify the ``pom.xml`` and build the GeoMesa FileSystem geoserver plugin
project from scratch with Maven.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tar -xzvf \
      geomesa-fs_${VERSION}/dist/gs-plugins/geomesa-fs-gs-plugin_${VERSION}-install.tar.gz \
      -C /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib

Next, install the JARs for Hadoop. By default, JARs will be downloaded from Maven central. You may
override this by setting the environment variable ``GEOMESA_MAVEN_URL``. If you do not have an internet connection
you can download the JARs manually.

Edit the file ``geomesa-fs_${VERSION}/conf/dependencies.sh`` to set the version of Hadoop
to match the target environment, and then run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/install-dependencies.sh /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib

The FileSystem data store requires the configuration file ``core-site.xml`` to be on the classpath. This can
be accomplished by placing the file in ``geoserver/WEB-INF/classes`` (you should make the directory if it
doesn't exist). Utilizing a symbolic link will be useful here so any changes are reflected in GeoServer.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ln -s /path/to/core-site.xml /path/to/geoserver/WEB-INF/classes/core-site.xml

Restart GeoServer after the JARs are installed.

GeoMesa Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoMesa provides some WPS processes, such as ``geomesa:Density`` which is used to generate heat maps. In order
to use these processes, install the GeoServer WPS plugin as described in :ref:`geomesa_process`.
