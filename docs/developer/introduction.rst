GeoMesa Development
===================

This chapter describes how to build GeoMesa from source and provides an
overview of the process of developing GeoMesa.

Using Maven
-----------

The GeoMesa project uses `Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ as a build tool. The Maven project's
`Maven in 5 Minutes <https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html>`__ provides a
quick introduction to getting started with its ``mvn`` executable.

Building from Source
--------------------

These development tools are required:

* `Java JDK 8`_
* `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ |maven_version|
* A ``git`` `client <http://git-scm.com/>`__

The GeoMesa source distribution may be cloned from GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa.git
    $ cd geomesa

Building and dependency management for GeoMesa is handled by `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__.
The Maven ``pom.xml`` file in the root directory of the source distribution contains a
list of dependent libraries that will be bundled together for each module of the program. Build using the
``mvn`` executable:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install

The `skipTests` property may be used to reduce build time, as it omits the test phase of the build process:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

To compile for Google Bigtable, use the ``bigtable`` profile:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -Pbigtable

The ``build/mvn`` script is a wrapper around Maven that builds the project using the
`Zinc <https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc>`__ incremental compiler:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ build/mvn clean install -DskipTests

Scala
-----

For the most part, GeoMesa is written in `Scala <http://www.scala-lang.org/>`__,
and is compiled with Scala 2.11.7.

Using the Scala Console
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test and interact with core functionality, the Scala console can be invoked in a couple of ways. For example, by
running this command in the root source directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn scala:console -pl geomesa-accumulo/geomesa-accumulo-datastore

The Scala console will start, and all of the project packages in ``geomesa-accumulo-datastore`` will be loaded along
with ``JavaConversions`` and ``JavaConverters``.
